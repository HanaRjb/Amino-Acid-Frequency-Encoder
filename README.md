# Amino Acid Frequency Encoding

This repository contains a Python script that reads a FASTA file and encodes the frequency of each amino acid present in the sequences. The output is saved as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features

- Reads amino acid sequences from a FASTA file.
- Counts the frequency of each amino acid (A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y).
- Outputs the frequency counts into a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

## Usage

1. Place your input FASTA file named `H_train.txt` in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

3. The encoded frequencies will be saved in a file named `split_Amino_H.csv` in the same directory.

## Code Overview

The main steps in the code include:

- Importing necessary libraries.
- Reading the FASTA file using a custom `readFasta` module.
- Counting the frequency of each amino acid in the sequences.
- Storing the results in a NumPy matrix and converting it to a Pandas DataFrame.
- Saving the DataFrame to a CSV file.

## Example

Here is a snippet of how the amino acid frequency is encoded:

```python
for sequence in fastas:
    # Count amino acids in the sequence
    code.append(sequence.count('A'))
    code.append(sequence.count('C'))
    # (Continues for all amino acids)
```
